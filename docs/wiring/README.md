ðŸ§  Amplifier Fault Logic System â€” Wiring Overview
Welcome to the modular fault logic documentation for your amplifier system. This repo contains a set of fault detection blocks â€” each independently documented and wired â€” that work together to monitor bias, thermal, and overcurrent conditions. Faults are latched and relayed for diagnostics and protection.

ðŸ”— Signal Flow Summary
Analog Inputs: Bias, current, and temperature are monitored via comparators

Fault Outputs: Active HIGH signals feed into FaultAggregation_Block

Latch Logic: Faults are held until reset via FaultLatch_Block_A

Relay Control: Latched faults mute output and trigger LED indicators

Test Points: Embedded across blocks for diagnostics and calibration
